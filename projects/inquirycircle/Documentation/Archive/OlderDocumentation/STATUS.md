<!-- InquiryCircle2 – STATUS – Stage2 – 9/7/2025 at 8:00 AM ET -->

# Project Status

## Current State
- **Stage**: Stage 2 - Ready for Implementation
- **Last Updated**: September 7, 2025 at 8:00 AM ET
- **Git Repository**: Synchronized at `/home/scott/inquirycircle` (main branch)
- **GitHub**: Repository active at https://github.com/scott009/InquiryCircle

## Today's Progress

### ✅ Documentation Consolidation (Completed)
- Consolidated 8 Stage2Docs into 5 streamlined documents
- Moved documentation to `/mnt/c/Users/scott/Documents/AIProjects/Markdown/InquiryCircle2/Documentation/`
- Eliminated redundancies while preserving all information

### ✅ Git Repository Setup (Completed)
- Initialized Git repository at `/home/scott/inquirycircle`
- Set main branch as default
- Created comprehensive .gitignore file
- Added Version Control section to Infrastructure.md

### ✅ GitHub Integration (Completed)
- Created new InquiryCircle repository on GitHub (scott009)
- Renamed old repository to InquiryCircle-legacy
- Updated Infrastructure.md with repository information

### ✅ Project Cleanup (Completed)
- Removed old Stage 1 files (IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md, old docker-compose files)
- Removed Caddyfile configs (managed on VPS from Stage 1)
- Moved .env.example to compose/ directory
- Preserved correct directory structure

## Current Project Structure
```
/home/scott/inquirycircle/
├── .git/                  # Git repository (initialized)
├── .gitignore            # Comprehensive ignore patterns
├── compose/
│   └── .env.example      # Environment template
├── caddy/
│   ├── logs/            # Empty (git-ignored)
│   └── site/dist/       # Empty (git-ignored)
├── frontend/            # Empty (ready for Vue 3)
└── backend/             # Empty (ready for Django)
```

## Important Decisions Made
1. **Caddy configs NOT in repo** - Stage 1 completed, configs live on VPS
2. **Documentation separate** - Lives at Windows path, not in Git repo
3. **Clean slate for Stage 2** - All old files removed, structure ready

### ✅ Git Setup Complete (September 7, 2025)
- ✅ Initial commit created with project structure
- ✅ GitHub remote origin connected
- ✅ Directory structure preserved with .gitkeep files
- ✅ Repository synchronized and ready for development

## Next Tasks - Stage 2 Implementation

### Agreed Implementation Order
1. **Django Backend** - API foundation (Models, REST endpoints, SQLite, Authentication)
2. **Docker Compose** - Container infrastructure (Backend container, networking, volumes)
3. **Vue 3 Frontend** - UI application (Tailwind CSS, Jitsi SDK, API integration)
4. **Integration & Testing** - Full stack verification (Caddy routing, end-to-end flows)

### Implementation Phases
#### Phase 1: Django Backend Setup  (Completed)
- [ ] Initialize Django project with REST framework
- [ ] Create data models (Circles, Keys/Auth, Messages, Sessions)
- [ ] Implement key-based authentication system
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints
- [ ] Set up SQLite database and migrations
- [ ] Test API endpoints independently

#### Phase 2: Docker Configuration   (Completed)
- [ ] Create Django backend Dockerfile
- [ ] Build docker-compose.dev.yml for development
- [ ] Configure container networking and volumes
- [ ] Test backend container deployment
- [ ] Verify SQLite persistence across restarts

#### Phase 3: Vue 3 Frontend  (Completed)
- [x ] Initialize Vue 3 project with Vite
- [x ] Configure Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- [x ] Integrate Jitsi Meet SDK
- [x ] Implement API client for backend communication
- [x ] Build key-based authentication UI
- [x ] Create circle management interface
- [x ] Develop video conferencing components
- [x ] Test frontend against containerized backend

#### Phase 4: Integration & Deployment  (Completed) 
- [x ] Configure Caddy reverse proxy routing
- [x ] Test full stack locally with Docker Compose
- [x ] Implement external Jitsi room management
- [x ] End-to-end authentication and session flow testing
- [ ] Deploy to VPS (catbench.com)
- [ ] Production verification and monitoring setup

## Project Context

### Infrastructure Status
- **Stage 1**: ✅ Complete - Caddy reverse proxy working on WSL and VPS
- **Stage 2**: In Progress - Application development (Vue + Django)
- **Stage 3**: Future - Self-hosted Jitsi, PostgreSQL migration

### Environment Paths
- **WSL Development**: `/home/scott/inquirycircle`
- **VPS Production**: `/srv/inquirycircle`
- **Documentation**: `/mnt/c/Users/scott/Documents/AIProjects/Markdown/InquiryCircle2/Documentation/`

### GitHub Repositories
- **Main**: https://github.com/scott009/InquiryCircle (active, project structure ready)
- **Legacy**: https://github.com/scott009/InquiryCircle-legacy (old work)
- **Docker**: https://github.com/scott009/DockerIC (experiments)

## Notes
- **Implementation Strategy**: Backend-first approach for solid API foundation
- **Stage 2 Focus**: Full application stack (Vue frontend + Django backend + Docker containers)
- **Infrastructure**: Caddy reverse proxy already configured from Stage 1
- **Repository Status**: Clean structure synchronized with GitHub, ready for development
- **Documentation**: Authoritative source maintained separately at Windows path
- **Testing Keys:  Facilitator: facilitator-key-123   |   Participant: participant-key-456
- Secrets - such as passwords and keys are kept in birwarden in a secure note

Today   
Perfect! The API is returning proper JSON responses, not HTML. I can see:

  1. Authentication endpoint: {"valid": false, "error": "Invalid key"} (JSON ✅)
  2. Health endpoint: {"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"} (JSON ✅)
  3. Invalid key test: Same JSON error response (JSON ✅)  
  add the test keys to the production database
