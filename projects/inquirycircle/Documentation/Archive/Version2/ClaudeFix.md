## Explanation
 The issue you're encountering is a common Docker volume mounting problem. When you mount ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy, Docker is mounting your Caddyfile to the entire /etc/caddy  directory instead of the specific Caddyfile location. Here's how to fix it:
Solution 1: Mount to the correct file path
Change your docker-compose.yml to mount the Caddyfile to the specific file location:  
    
  

version: '3.8'

services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    container_name: caddy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile  # Mount to specific file
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    networks:
      - app-network
    depends_on:
      - django
      - frontend

  django:
    build: ./backend
    container_name: django
    expose:
      - "8000"
    networks:
      - app-network
    # Add your Django configuration here

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    container_name: vue-frontend
    expose:
      - "3000"
    networks:
      - app-network
    # Add your Vue.js configuration here

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
