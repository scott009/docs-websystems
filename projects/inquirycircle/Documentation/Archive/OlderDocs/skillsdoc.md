  - Excellent Tailwind CSS integration
  - Strategic choice for manageable complexity

### Database Architecture Considerations
- **Evaluated**: Traditional SQL vs Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Decision**: SQL with planned migration path
- **Implementation**: SQLite (development) â†’ PostgreSQL (production)
- **Reasoning**:
  - Superior Django ORM integration
  - Larger support community
  - Existing SQL experience
  - **Note**: Demonstrated advanced understanding by exploring graph databases and has Cypher language experience

### Authentication System Design
- **Approach**: Simple access key system vs robust user authentication
