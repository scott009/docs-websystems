
General Discussion

-------------------------
I would like to create a set of reactions
each reaction is represented by a visible button in the interface. (A DISPLAY COMPONANT) 
the button sits outside the iframe itself

-------------------------------------


Each reaction also has a user selectable modifier: 
REACTION MODIFIERS
Anonymous reactions - The speaker sees the reaction but does not see who its from
Accredited reactions - the speaker sees the reaction and who sent it  
Secret reactions - only the facilitatior sees the reactions 
=========================

REACTIONS
like
love
dislike
hate
agree
disagree
go on
hurry up
boring
intereseting 
sympathy
laugh

--------------------------
create a unit testing so each reaction object can be tested outside of the interface

-----------------------------------------
use interfaces to prepare for a later versions use of a standalone jitsi server.
