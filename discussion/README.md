# Discussion Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains records of discussions with other people or AI systems that may inform project documentation before being integrated into official project docs.

## Structure
- Discussion files are organized by topic or project
- Each discussion includes context, participants, and key insights
- Files serve as a staging area before formal documentation updates

## Guidelines
- Include date, participants, and summary for each discussion
- Use clear naming conventions (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`)
- Cross-reference related project documentation when applicable
- Mark discussions as "integrated" when content moves to official docs

## Integration Process
1. Discussion → analysis → refinement
2. Extract actionable insights and decisions
3. Update relevant project documentation
4. Mark discussion file with integration status
